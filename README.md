## What is ChuGoo?

ChuGoo is a radically open-source platform which aims to enable anyone to take action on the climate crisis.
A very basic prototype of the platform can be seen here: https://kumar-ish.github.io/index.html#

The aim of this project is to develop a platform by the people, for the people, that enables climate action.

History is unfolding before our eyes: The recent climate strikes occurred in 150 countries, and often exceeded one-hundred thousand participants, cascading from the School Strike for Climate, itself spearheaded by one sixteen year-old girl - Greta Thunberg.

Furthermore, in recent years we have witnessed the immense power of distributed-trust systems, evidenced by the current proliferation of open-source software, and the recent emergence of blockchain.

ChuGoo is inspired by the incredible power we have as individuals and as a collective, and aims to provide a platform where everyone can have a tangible impact in the fight against climate-change.

An awesome way to do this is plant trees: They're the best technology we have right now for carbon capture. With that in mind, we want to create a radically transparent platform where anyone can contribute to the tree-planting, whether it be by volunteering for some tree-planting project, or by sponsoring it. We think tree-planting is a great way to get everyone involved, and to foster greater connection between communities and the environment.

We hope to eventually branch into major reforestation projects, and aid in the development of a wide range of renewable-energy power-stations.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
